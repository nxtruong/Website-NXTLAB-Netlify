This policy outlines the expectations for authorship on research papers produced in our lab. It is intended for all members—faculty, postdocs, PhD students, MS students, and undergraduates. Our goal is to ensure transparency, fairness, and professionalism in the publication process, in alignment with academic standards.

## General Authorship Criteria

Authorship must reflect a **substantial intellectual contribution** to the research. This typically includes contributions such as:

* Formulating the problem
* Designing the methodology
* Performing analysis
* Interpreting results
* Writing the manuscript
* Supervising the research work (typically by the PI or a senior researcher)

**Merely performing routine tasks**—such as coding, data collection, or running experiments—without substantial engagement in the above activities does **not** warrant authorship.


## First Authorship Expectations

The **first author** is the lead contributor and carries the **primary responsibility** for the paper. This includes:

* **Developing the core ideas or technical work** of the paper
* **Writing the first complete draft** of the manuscript
* **Leading all stages** of the publication process:

  * Initial draft writing and revision
  * Incorporating feedback from all coauthors
  * Formatting and submitting the manuscript
  * Leading responses to reviewers’ comments in each round
  * Finalizing the camera-ready version upon acceptance

First authorship is **not** justified if:

* The person only contributed technical components (e.g., simulation code, data generation) but did **not** engage in writing or leading the writing process
* The person contributed initially but **abandoned the effort** before submission or during review
* The manuscript was completed primarily by others after the initial draft or technical work


## Role of Junior Researchers

Junior researchers (e.g., PhD students before candidacy, MS students, and undergraduate students) are encouraged and supported to take lead roles on papers. However, they must:

* Take **ownership** of the full process as described above
* Be **open and responsive** to feedback from senior coauthors, including more senior students, postdocs, and faculty
* Understand that writing is an **iterative and collaborative process**, and incorporating others’ suggestions is essential for quality and integrity


## Coauthorship Etiquette

* All coauthors must be kept informed during the drafting and submission process
* Major changes to content or authorship order must be discussed with the advisor/supervisor
* All coauthors must approve the final version before submission and resubmission


## Examples

**Example 1: Appropriate First Authorship**
A student proposes a new algorithm, implements it, designs experiments, writes the first draft, revises based on coauthors’ input, and leads the paper through peer review. This student is first author.

**Example 2: Not Appropriate for First Authorship**
A student implements a system and collects results, but the idea, writing, and revisions are all led and completed by another student. The first student is a coauthor, but not the first author.

**Example 3: Change in First Authorship**
A student begins a project and contributes initial code and a rough draft, but leaves before submission. Another student completes the writing, handles revisions, and finalizes the paper. The second student becomes first author, and the first student remains a coauthor if the contribution was substantial.


## Final Note
Authorship is a recognition of responsibility and intellectual contribution. When in doubt, lab members should consult the advisor/supervisor early in the process to ensure fair authorship assignment.
