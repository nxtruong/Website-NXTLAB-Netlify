Prof. Nghiem was recognized by the University of Central Florida's leadership for his NSF CAREER award.  Together with four other faculty members at UCF, Prof. Nghiem's award and research were introduced in a news article ["5 UCF Researchers Use 2025 NSF CAREER Awards to Address Emerging Challenges in Computer Science, Engineering "](https://www.ucf.edu/news/5-ucf-researchers-use-2025-nsf-career-awards-to-address-emerging-challenges-in-computer-science-and-engineering/). We appreciate UCF, especially the Vice President for Research, for the special recognition.
