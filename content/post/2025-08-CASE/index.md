We had a paper presented at the 2025 IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE) in Los Angeles, California, USA.
The paper is titled "CRADLE: Cooperative Adaptive Decentralized Learning and Execution for UAV network to monitor Wildfire Front" and is a collaboration with Prof. Hung (Jim) La at the University of Nevada, Reno.
Dr. Binh Nguyen (our postdoc) and Prof. Truong Nghiem are coauthors in the paper.
