Four graduate students joined our lab in the Fall 2025 semester.
- Nam Tran Nguyen (formerly an MS student in our lab) completed his MS at Northern Arizona University and joined us at UCF.  He is a PhD student, focusing on machine learning and control.
- Trinh Tran joined us from Vietnam. She is a PhD student, focusing on distributed optimization and control, multi-agent systems, and learning-enhanced optimization.
- Donovan Ho and Andrew Mitchell (formerly undergraduate students in our lab at UCF) joined us as MS students in the Robotics and Autonomous Systems program.

Welcome Nam, Trinh, Donovan, and Andrew to our lab.  Hope you will all have a great time and success in our lab and in your studies / research.
