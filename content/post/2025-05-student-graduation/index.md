Huge congratulations to our two masters' students, Nam Nguyen and Juan Carlos Tique-Rangel, who successfully defended their theses and graduated from Northern Arizona University (the former institution of our lab).
- Nam will join us at UCF.
- Juan will join Lehigh University as a Ph.D. student in Computer Science.

Good luck, Nam and Juan, in your future endeavors.  May success be with you in your career and personal life.
