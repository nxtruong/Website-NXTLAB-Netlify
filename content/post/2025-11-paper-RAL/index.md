A paper titled ["SIT-LMPC: Safe Information-Theoretic Learning Model Predictive Control for Iterative Tasks"](https://doi.org/10.1109/LRA.2025.3634881) has been published in the journal [IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=7083369).  The paper develops an iterative control framework based on an information-theoretic model predictive control algorithm to address a constrained infinite-horizon optimal control problem for discrete-time nonlinear stochastic systems.  Autonomous race car simulations and real-world experiments were conducted to validate and demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework; see our [project website](https://sites.google.com/view/sit-lmpc/).  This paper is a collaboration with Prof. Rahul Mangharam's x-lab at the University of Pennsylvania.
