We welcomed [Dr. Praveen Jawaharlal Ayyanathan](/author/praveen-jawaharlal-ayyanathan/) to our research lab as a postdoctoral scholar.  He will be leading our efforts in developing autonomous UAVs for complex, GPS-denied forest environments, as part of our USDA NIFA-funded project.

[Ivanna Dovbysh](/author/ivanna-dovbysh/) joined us as a masterâ€™s student.  A Fulbright scholar, Ivanna will be working on perception and sensor fusion for autonomous UAVs.

Hope you will all have a great time and success in our lab and in your studies / research.
