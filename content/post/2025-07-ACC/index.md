Our lab had three papers at the 2025 American Control Conference in Denver, Colorado, USA.
- A paper titled "Physics-Constrained Taylor Neural Networks for Learning and Control of Dynamical Systems" was presented by Nam Nguyen. Co-authors: Juan Tique and Prof. Truong Nghiem.
- A paper titled ["Spatially temporally distributed informative path planning for multi-robot systems"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16489) was presented by Dr. Binh Nguyen.
- A tutorial paper titled ["Safe Physics-Informed Machine Learning for Dynamics and Control"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12952) was presented in the tutorial session ["Safe Physics-Informed Machine Learning for Dynamics and Control"](https://github.com/nxt-lab/2025-ACC-Tutorial-session-Safe-PIML), co-organized by Prof. Truong Nghiem. The session attracted a large audience of over 100 people.
