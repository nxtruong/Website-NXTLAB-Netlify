Our lab had two papers accepted at two different conferences.
- A paper titled "LEAP-O: Learning to Predict Dynamic Obstacles for Safe Trajectory Planning" was accepted to the 2026 American Control Conference. We developed a data-driven method for learning to predict the motion of dynamic obstacles and incorporate it into path planning to ensure safe trajectories of autonomous robots. Authors include Dr. Binh Nguyen (postdoc) and Prof. Truong Nghiem.
- A paper titled "$\partial$CBDs: Differentiable Causal Block Diagrams" was accepted to the 2026 ACM/IEEE International Conference on Cyber-Physical Systems (ICCPS) - a prestigious international conference on cyber-physical systems. This paper was a collaboration between Prof. Truong Nghiem and Prof. Jan Drgona (JHU) and Prof. Thomas Beckers (Vanderbilt University).
