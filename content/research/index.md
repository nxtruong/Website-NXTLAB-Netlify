      text: |
        Our research and research approaches are multi-disciplinary, combining theories and techniques from
        - *Computer science*: machine learning, AI, scientific computing;
        - *Electrical and computer engineering*: control theory, edge computing, internet-of-things (IoT), sensors, embedded systems;
        - *Applied mathematics*: optimization theory, dynamical systems;
        - and various application domains.

        We are particularly interested in the following application areas:
        - **AI-enabled smart and sustainable energy systems** such as smart buildings, connected communities, smart grids, smart cities.
        - **Smart environment sensing and monitoring systems** such as mobile robotic sensor networks (MRSN), wireless sensor networks, IoT sensing and monitoring in the built environments.
        - **Data-driven control and optimization**.

        <!-- - **Learning-based intelligent control systems** that combine machine learning (and AI), computing, optimization, and control theory.  Applications are in energy systems (particularly smart buildings and connected communities), multi-agent systems (e.g., mobile sensing networks), and transportation (e.g., advanced driver-assistance systems, self-driving cars, autonomous drones). -->
